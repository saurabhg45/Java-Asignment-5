#Java Assignment - 5

1.    Bob has his money deposited $1000, $1500 and $2000 in banks-Bank A, Bank B and Bank C respectively. We have to print the money deposited by him in a particular bank.
Create a class 'Bank' with a method 'getBalance' which returns 0 and another method ‘applyInterest’ which return the accountbalance. Make its three subclasses named 'BankA', 'BankB' and 'BankC' with a method with the same name 'getBalance' which returns the amount deposited in that particular bank. Override the method ‘applyInterest’ by adding the interest calculated with the Bank’s interest rate (Static variable for the Bank class). Call the method 'getBalance' and ‘applyInterest’ by the
Object of each of the three banks.

3.    Create a class 'Student' with three data members which are name, age and address. The constructor of the class assigns default values name as "unknown", age as '0' and address as "not available". It has two

parameters for name and age and assigns the same whereas the second method takes has three parameters which are assigned to name, age and address respectively. Print the name, age and address of 10 students.

'Postgraduate'each having a method with the same name that prints"I am an Undergraduate" and "I am a Postgraduate" respectively.Call the method by creating an object of each of the three classes.

5.Implement Multilevel Inheritance with Method Overriding
    Create a base class Person.Create a subclass Employee that extends Person, and includes the methods work() and getSalary().Create another subclass HRManager that extends Employee, overrides the work() method, and adds a new method addEmployee() to simulate adding employees.
